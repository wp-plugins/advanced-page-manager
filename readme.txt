A new way to create, move, edit and publish your pages for your favorite CMS.

== Description ==

**It is hard to manage Wordpress pages when it comes to have more than 10 static pages, right ?** Current UI makes it difficult to manage a whole tree of pages. Advanced Page Manager aims to create a totally new Page Manager Panel designed to help you get the job done.

= So, what should you expect from this plugin ? =

* **An easy understand tree.** All your pages are presented in an easy to understand tree with all necessary actions to take care of them.
* **Browse, Show/hide subpages.** The plugin even remembers the state of each page so that you won't have to browse again and again the tree to find the same page.
* **Classic actions.** Of course, classic actions such as *Edit*, *Preview*/*View* are still there !
* **Add, move and delete pages from within the tree.** But you will also be able to add, move and delete pages from within the tree. And no more cumbersome drag/drop to move pages. We have created a zen way for you to do that :-) Also, you don't have to edit to add a page anymore. Just click the *Add New* button.
* **New Status for pages.** Wordpress Status are fine for posts but sound odd for pages. With APM, your pages are online or... offline. Simple no ?
* **Publish/unpublish.** Push online (or pull offline) one or more pages directly from the tree.
* **Template Management.** Affect or change template for 1 page or any selected range of pages.
* **Select pages.** We also provide an easy way to select all subpages for a given parent page.
* **Where is my page ?** From the *Edit* panel, the result lists or even the theme itself, you'll be able to find your page in the tree thanks to the *Where my page?* button.
* **Search and filter.** Search for pages. Filter to get the list of all online or offline pages. Sort by column in result lists.
* **No clumsy interface.** As you, we love the Wordpress UI. You'll feel at home with APM. The plugin interface matches Wordpress standards.
* **Theme integration.** We also respect your theme. Pages are still pages even managed by APM. No need to change your templates.
* **Template Tags.** However, we provide a new set of Template Tags to handle pages in your themes. Feel free to use them if you need to.
* **Don't like it ?** Under the hood, it's still Wordpress. If you uninstall APM, your pages will be there because it's your content and we care for it.
* **Don't speak English ?** APM is also available in French. Want it in your language ? All strings are available to translation in the [Wordpress way](http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress).

**Download and install Advanced Page Manager to fully enjoy it !**

1. Clic the "Save Changes" button (of the *Addons* box)


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What happen to the regular Wordpress pages when the plugin is installed ? =
Well nothing at all. The plugin creates a new management panel and still relies on the regular Wordpress pages. However we do use a new way to store page relationships to speed up display. Also we don't create any new database table and regular relationships are maintained. If you uninstall the plugin, pages will be there safe and sane.

= Does the plugin have hooks ? =
Currently, APM has some hooks but not in a consistent way. We are going to develop a lot more hooks in the post 1.0 era. Currently, hooks are available to add custom columns and action links (see *Other Notes* tab)

= What are addons ? =
Addons are optional functionalities you can activate from the *Settings* menu (see *Installation* tab). Think them as plugins for... plugin. At the moment, there is only one addon which allows to add a *Last Modified* sortable column in panels.

= Is the plugin compatible with the Wordpress menu builder ? =
Yes. The plugin manages regular pages and the menu builder has still access to them.

= Do I have to modify my theme ? =
No. Regular page template tags and functions still work. Regular page template and permalinks are also supported. We do have new template tags, however it is not mandatory to use them.

= Does the plugin support extra columns in the page tree and lists ? =
We've looked at the WP core itself and to several plugins making use of those extra columns (as Simply Exclude or Wordpress SEO for example). We found 2 things. First, using the WP hook is very difficult as it expects to be on the original panel. Second, plugins insert themselves in many ways into the Pages panel (eg. bringing new scripts testing the current URL). So unfortunatly, we came to the conclusion that we won't support extra columns as it will introduce to much specific and unstable code in our plugin. However, we perfectly understand the importance of this feature for the users and the developpers. So we've added following hooks to add extra columns : apm_manage_pages_columns, apm_manage_pages_custom_column and apm_load_wp_data (see *Other Notes* tab)

= Is there known issues with other plugins? =
Yes. Notably, we don't support Advanced Access Manager and WPML.

= How do I report a bug ? =
Please, use the *Support* tab. However, remember this is not a commercial support of any kind. We check regularly the coming requests and questions and try to keep up with answering them. But we also have regular jobs and... lifes. One more detail : at the moment, we're all located in France. So if you are in another timezone, remember that even french sleep (yes I know, weird).

= Do you accept patches ? =
Yes (and we thank you in advance if so). All patches will be validated by our lead developer (yes that's you Mathieu). If accepted, you'll be mentionned as contributor to the plugin (if you accept so). To submit a patch please report in the *Support* tab.

= Do you have a website for this plugin ? =
Yes and... no :-) Home for APM is here : [http://www.uncategorized-creations.com/](http://www.uncategorized-creations.com/). At the moment, it's a single page with a logo. You can leave your email address to get fresh news about APM. In far distant future, it might be a complete website. In the meantime, you can also follow us on Twitter : [@uncatcrea](https://twitter.com/UncatCrea).

= Which version of Wordpress do you support ? =
We support Wordpress 3.4.2 to the 4.0. We don't plan to support earlier versions.

= Which version of browsers do you support ? =
All developments have been done under the last version of Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Internet Explorer (Windows 7).

= Which language do you support ? =
By default, APM is in English and French. If you wish to, you can translate the interface in your own language [in the standard Wordpress way](http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress). You'll find all translation here: [http://uncategorized-creations.com/advanced-page-manager/translations/](http://uncategorized-creations.com/advanced-page-manager/translations/).

= What is Uncategorized Creations ? =
*Uncategorized Creations* is the name chosen by a bunch of (french) Wordpress addicts (technical or not). Advanced Page Manager is their first creation. Please see the *Other Notes* tab for more details.


== Screenshots ==

1. Pages are presented as a nice tree. Clicking on the *arrow* will fold (or unfold) subpages.
2. Rollover a page will reveal the *Action Menu* for this page : *Rename*, *Preview*/*View*, *Publish*, *Edit*, *Template*, *Move* and *Delete* (if you're connected with the admin role).
3. You can select a page. And, if it has subpages, you have access to a submenu to select/unselect its subpages.
4. By default, new pages are offline. Clicking the *Publish* action link will publish/unpublish it instantaneously.
5. Clicking on the *Template* action link opens a side panel where you can change the page template.
6. You can select several pages and apply one of the bulk actions : *Publish*/*Unpublish*, *Change Template* or *Delete* (if you're connected with the admin role).
7. Click on the *Add New* button (on the right of each page), it opens a side panel to add one (or more) page(s). You can choose the template to apply, the position of the new page and you can also create more than one page at a time.
8. To move a page, click the *Move* action link. Then browse the page tree and decide where to drop the selected page.
9. You have access to the lists of all pages online or offline. You can also search. In result lists, the *Where is it?* button allows to switch back to the tree where the page is displayed in context.
10. When editing a page, the *Page Attributes* metabox allows to change template. You have a *Where is it?* button to switch back to the tree and you can edit next, previous, parent and subpages without returning to the tree.

* Purpose : allows to add or modify columns to display on the APM pages tree and lists
* Takes one argument / return value
* **$apm_columns** : associative array where keys are the name of the columns, and values are the header texts for those columns
* The usage is the same as [the native "manage_pages_columns" WordPress hook](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/manage_pages_columns)

**apm_manage_pages_custom_column**

* Type : action
* Purpose : displays the custom column information for each page row in the APM tree.

* **$post_id** : WordPress ID of the page row being displayed (int)
* **$apm_node** : APM specific data about this page (object)
* The usage is the same as [the native "manage_pages_custom_column" WordPress hook](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/manage_pages_custom_column)

      //it here using update_post_caches() on $found_pages :
      update_post_caches($found_pages,'page');

      <span class="my_action"><a href="#" title="My Action">My action</a></span>
      <?php

= Who's behind this plugin ? =

*January the 21st, 2013* - Advanced Page Manager has been designed and developed by a group of Wordpress addicts doing professional Wordpress projects (among other things like living a normal life). The idea of Advanced Page Manager emerged as we were working on news sites with a lot of pro contents that were... not news but kind of knowledge base (eg. best practices, tutorials...). It was obvious that we could do those contents with standard posts but we had also to twist them in a way we felt as not as a good way to go. So we decided to give a boost to Wordpress pages to match a more CMS like management. But we also felt that we had to respect Wordpress (UI of course and also technically speaking). We are very happy to release it after 4 months of hard work and hope that you will enjoy it in your own projects.

We'd like to thank the [*Groupe Moniteur*](http://www.groupemoniteur.fr/), a french B2B news company, that allowed us to develop this project. More specificaly, we thank Caroline Tessier and Claire de Smedt, both wonderful project managers for their help (and patience).
